        Welcome, I am a Full Stack Web Developer known as GrittyByt based in
        Atlanta, GA, and this is my portfolio.  I have extensive knowledge in multiple computer language
        disciplines ranging from <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>,

        <span>ReactJS</span>, <span>MySQL</span>, <span>NoSQL</span>, and more.  
        I have a 9 year history of graphic design work utilizing the Adobe Creative 
        Suite tools which allows me the full range of customizing icons and badges to 
        my clients' desires; however there is a plethora of designs I'm adept to 
        creating as you'll see the more you explore my portfolio.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started my programming journey being self-taught in 2019; however I have formal training
        from the University of Texas - Austin under their Full Stack Web Developer program,
        and currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia State University. 
        The knowledge I possess in front-end & back-end programming languages will enable us
        to work collectively in the design of your website to be whatever your creative minds 
        can muster.  I look forward to working with you all in designing, debugging, and decoding to create 
        the cornerstones of your tomorrow.
